# BuildItBigger
Android Nanodegree Project - Build It Bigger


In this project, I will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Could Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.
